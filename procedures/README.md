# Procedures - Tiro's Muscle Memory

This directory contains **step-by-step procedures** for tasks Tiro has learned to perform. Think of these as procedural memory — the "how to" knowledge that gets faster with repetition.

## How to Use

1. **Before attempting a multi-step task**, check if a procedure exists here
2. **Follow the procedure exactly** — it was tested and works
3. **After completing a task a new way**, write the procedure here
4. **After a procedure fails**, update it with what actually works

## Naming Convention

- `how-to-<action>.md` — e.g., `how-to-check-canvas-assignments.md`
- `workflow-<name>.md` — for multi-tool workflows
- `troubleshoot-<problem>.md` — for diagnosing known issues

## Template

```markdown
# How to [Task Name]

**Last verified:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Tools required:** [list of skills/tools needed]
**Estimated time:** X minutes

## Steps

1. Step one (exact command or action)
2. Step two
3. ...

## Common Failures

- **[Error X]** → Fix: [solution]

## Notes

- Any context that helps
```

## Why This Matters

Without procedural memory, every session starts from scratch. With it, Tiro gets faster and more reliable at recurring tasks — just like a human employee building expertise.
